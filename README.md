## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **DevOps / DevSecOps Engineer** with a security mindset — obsessed with **infrastructure correctness, observability, and failure-proof systems**.

I work where **cloud, automation, and security intersect**:
- Large-scale cloud migrations (AWS → GCP / Azure)
- Kubernetes & service mesh architectures
- Terraform-driven infrastructure at scale
- Production-grade logging, monitoring & alerting
- Security-aware system design (not afterthoughts)

I don’t just deploy systems — **I harden them, observe them, and prepare them to fail safely.**

## 🛠️ Tech Arsenal

### ☁️ Cloud & Infra
- **GCP, AWS, Azure**
- VPCs, IAM, Load Balancers, DNS, Private Networking
- MIGs, ASGs, Bastion, NAT, Zero-Trust patterns

### ⚙️ DevOps & Automation
- **Terraform** (modular, multi-env, prod-grade)
